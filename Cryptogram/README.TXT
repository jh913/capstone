PROJECT TITLE: Cryptogram
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Capstone
VERSION or DATE: 13 April 2016
DEPENDENCIES:
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Run the main method of the Cryptogram class
AUTHORS: Justin Huang
USER INSTRUCTIONS:
1) Start the Cryptogram program by running the main method of the Cryptogram class.
2) The program will ask whether you want to encode a message or decode a code.
    Type "encode" or "decode" in any case and press the Enter key.
3) The program will prompt you for the message to encode or code to decode.
    Type the message or code and press the Enter key.
    The program will give you the corresponding code or message.
4) The program will ask whether or not you want to encode another message or decode another code.
    Type "Y" or "N" in any case and press the Enter key.
    If you respond "Y", the program will loop back to step 2.
    If you respond "N", the program will end and you will be able to close the window.

The Cryptogram2 program also prompts you for the number of characters to move the characters in
your message to the right or the characters in your code to the left. This occurs after the
program prompts you for the message or code (in step 3).
